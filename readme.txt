Simple configurable widgetized count down plugin.

== Description ==

This plugin will display a count down in days until a certain date.
This date can be set in the wordpress administration panel as well as the text related to it.

For example:

* Our wedding will be in 14 days.
* 31 days until final exams.
* In 2 days Apple will release its iPad...

The plugin can be used in a widgetized sidebar or in your theme.

On the configuration panel is also a donation link, so you can chip in to my own wedding budget if you like.
The upcoming wedding of my fianc√©e and me was the inital reason of writing this plugin.
You can read about our wedding and preparations at [hasenha.us](http://www.hasenha.us/ "Willkommen im Hasenha.us!")
and of course you can see the plugin in action there.
